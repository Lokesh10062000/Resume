                  Worked on the development of a browser-based application using
                  React.js in user engagement. Improved application performance
                  by optimizing REST API calls and reducing load times.
                  Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure timely
                  delivery of project milestones.
                  <p>
                    • We used Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for the
                    database, and React for the front end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • We used Axios to handle the API requests on the front end,
                    facilitating seamless connection with the backend.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • Played a key role in diagnosing issues and bug fixing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • Collaborated closely with senior developers to plan and
                    present the data presentation layer for the application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • We used Visual Studio as the IDE for React and Eclipse for
                    the backend development.
                  </p>
